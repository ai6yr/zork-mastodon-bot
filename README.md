# zork-mastodon-bot

This is a short version of Zork implemented as a mastodon bot; the main point of this is not so much Zork as to have an example of a conversation-driven bot on Mastodon which stores user state.

## Mastodon setup

In order to have this script work, you need the following:
1. A dedicated Mastodon user account created on a server.
2. An "access key" for your app created for that user account. (under yourserver/settings/applications)
